        "> In logic, statistical inference, and supervised learning, transduction or\n",
        "transductive inference is reasoning from observed, specific (training) cases\n",
        "to specific (test) cases. In contrast, induction is reasoning from observed\n",
        "training cases to general rules, which are then applied to the test cases.\n",
        "The distinction is most interesting in cases where the predictions of the\n",
        "transductive model are not achievable by any inductive model. Note that this\n",
        "is caused by transductive inference on different test sets producing mutually\n",
        "inconsistent predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is the Tensor2Tensor [Transformer model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/master/tensor2tensor/models/transformer.py):\n",
        "\n",
        "> The Transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder. Both are stacks\n",
        "of self-attention layers followed by feed-forward layers. This model yields\n",
        "good results on a number of problems, especially in NLP and machine translation.\n",
        "See \"Attention Is All You Need\" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) for the full\n",
        "description of the model and the results obtained with its early version.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Transformer model](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCKhefrUMAE9stK.jpg)\n",
        "\n",
        "> The encoder is composed of a stack of N identical layers. Each layer has\n",
        "two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the\n",
        "second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network.\n",
        "There is a residual connection around each of the two sub-layers, followed by\n",

        "> The decoder is also composed of a stack of N identical layers. In addition\n",
        "to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third\n",
        "sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder\n",
        "stack. The self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack is modified to prevent\n",
        "positions from attending to subsequent positions.  This masking, combined with\n",
        "the fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",
