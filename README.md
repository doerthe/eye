# EYE

- [EYE] (http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/NOTE) is a reasoning engine supporting the RGB [Semantic Web layers] (http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/diagrams/sweb-stack/2006a).
- It performs semibackward reasoning and it supports [Euler paths] (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KoenigsbergBridgeProblem.html).
- Via [N3] (http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/) it is interoperable with [Cwm] (http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm).

- EYE [test cases] (http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2006/02swap/etc.sh) support the further [development] (http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/DEVELOPMENT) of EYE reasoning.
- EYE can be [installed manually] (http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/INSTALL) on Linux, Windows and MacOSX.
- EYE is also available in a [Docker container for command line use] (https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bdevloed/eye/) and in a [Docker container for HTTP client use] (https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bdevloed/eyeserver/).
