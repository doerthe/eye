# ![EYE](http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2003/03swap/eye.png) Euler Yet another proof Engine

- [EYE] (http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2006/02swap/eye-note.txt) is a reasoning engine supporting the [RGB semantic web layers] (http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/diagrams/sweb-stack/2006a).
- It is a semibackward reasoner enhanced with [Euler path] (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KoenigsbergBridgeProblem.html) detection.
- Via [N3] (http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/) it is interoperable with [Cwm] (http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm).
- The EYE [test cases] (http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2006/02swap/etc.sh) and their [results] (http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2006/02swap/etc/) support the development of EYE.
- EYE can be installed manually on [Linux] (README.Linux), [Windows] (README.Windows) and [MacOSX] (README.MacOSX).
- EYE is also available in a [Docker container for command line use] (https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bdevloed/eye/) and in a [Docker container for HTTP client use] (https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bdevloed/eyeserver/).
