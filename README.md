# Euler Yet another proof Engine

- [EYE] (http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2006/02swap/eye-note.txt) is a reasoning engine supporting the [RGB] (http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2006/02swap/rgb-note.txt) semantic web layers.
- It is a semibackward reasoner enhanced with [Euler path] (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KoenigsbergBridgeProblem.html) detection.
- Via [N3] (http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/) it is interoperable with [Cwm] (http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm).
- The EYE [test cases] (http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2006/02swap/etc.sh) and their [results] (http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2006/02swap/etc.n3) support the development of EYE.
- See also [README.Linux], [README.Windows] and [README.MacOSX].
