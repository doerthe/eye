# Euler Yet another proof Engine - EYE

<img align="left" src="https://josd.github.io/images/eye.png" alt="EYE"/> EYE is a reasoning engine supporting the [Semantic Web layers](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/diagrams/sweb-stack/2006a).<br/>
It performs semibackward reasoning and it supports [Euler paths](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KoenigsbergBridgeProblem.html).<br/>
Via [N3](http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/) it is interoperable with [Cwm](http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm).<br/>

See [RELEASE](https://github.com/josd/eye/blob/master/RELEASE), [README](https://github.com/josd/eye/blob/master/README), [INSTALL](https://github.com/josd/eye/blob/master/INSTALL) and [LICENSE](https://github.com/josd/eye/blob/master/LICENSE).<br/>
Things are described in [N3](http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/) thanks to [Tim Berners-Lee](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/) and [Dan Connolly](http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/).<br/>
