Multi-Agent Proofs
------------------

Multiple agents can work together by using their own knowledge/logic/data

The proofs are guaranteeing a transparent and accountable way of working
and they only disclose what is relevant, so there is no need to have an
"All knowledge is contained in here" (what I learned from Tim Berners-Lee).
